## Creating Snowflake Schema Database Using MS SQL Server

In this folder, I demonstrate how to create and design a database with Snowflake schema. I employed MS SQL Server
as the main database engine. I implemented several steps in designing this database as following.
1. Create corresponding tables for this database, such as Stocks Performance table as the fact tables and Stocks List as dimension table;
2. Import all related dataset to their designated tables; and
3. Determine both primary and foreign keys for fact and each dimension tables to create connections between tables.
